# F-14A-Cockpit
All the STL files for 3D printing a VR focussed F-14A Tomcat cockpit.

Disclaimer: This is designed to work as an artistic license version of a Tomcat which looks "about right" from a few feet away, and feels close enough while playing with a VR headset that the controls are where you reach for them. These files are provided for free to do what you like with and generally if they are uploaded then I have printed them at least once, but YMMV.
